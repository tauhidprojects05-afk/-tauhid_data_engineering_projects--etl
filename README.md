# Data Engineering Projects

Hands-on projects to reinforce core data engineering concepts from the SQL for Data Engineering course.

# Projects

## [1_EDA/](./1_EDA/) - Exploratory Data Analysis
![EDA Project Overview](../Resources/Images/1_1_Project1_EDA.png)
SQL-driven analysis of data engineer job market trends using advanced querying techniques.

**Skills**: Complex joins, aggregations, analytical functions, data quality validation


## 💻 SQL Skills Demonstrated

### Query Design & Optimization

- **Complex Joins**: Multi-table `INNER JOIN` operations across `job_postings_fact`, `skills_job_dim`, and `skills_dim`
- **Aggregations**: `COUNT()`, `MEDIAN()`, `ROUND()` for statistical analysis
- **Filtering**: Boolean logic with `WHERE` clauses and multiple conditions (`job_title_short`, `job_work_from_home`, `salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
- **Sorting & Limiting**: `ORDER BY` with `DESC` and `LIMIT` for top-N analysis

### Data Analysis Techniques

- **Grouping**: `GROUP BY` for categorical analysis by skill
- **Mathematical Functions**: `LN()` for natural logarithm transformation to normalize demand metrics
- **Calculated Metrics**: Derived optimal score combining log-transformed demand with median salary
- **HAVING Clause**: Filtering aggregated results (skills with >= 100 postings)
- **NULL Handling**: Proper filtering of incomplete records (`salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL`)
